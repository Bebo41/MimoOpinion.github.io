    <section>
        <h4>1-The lessons</h4>
        <p>The lessons in Mimo are pretty simple they just write at the top what it is teaching
           which is a very easy thing to understand, after that they ask you some questions in the middle
           to see if you're understanding and make you write the missing code too.
        </p>
        <h4>2-The projects</h4>
        <p>If the lesson was important they will give you some projects and rarly they may 
            give you some projects even if it was easy,but they don't give a lot of projects in 
            Java Script
        </p>
        <h4>3-The league</h4>
        <p>Mimo have a pretty simple league you just get XP after finishing eash lesson
            every correct answer is worth 10XP anid if you wasn't doing your lessons 
            frequently you will drop into a lower level league
        </p>
        <h5>The leagues:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li style="color: brown;">Wood</li>

            <li style="color: gold;">Gold</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>4-Community</h4>
        <p>There is a wonderful community in there anybody can post a topic
            or a proplem he/she has and everybody is going to try to help you
        </p>
        <h4>5-Certificate</h4>
        <p>I think the most important thing is the certificate and Mimo mad a great work 
            making it. Mimo has a lot of certificates with a signature and Mimo's logo
        </p>
        <h5>Certificates</h5>

        </ul>
        <p class="note"><em>NOTE: Mimo teaches full stack web development</em></p>
        <h4>6-Other</h4>
        <p>Mimo has a feature called super charge your knowlege which
            makes you practiceany lesson you forgot and Mimo also has
            playgrounds so you can try what you learnt
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>I recommend Mimo a lot as it is very good and will make you a great developer</p>
        <h4>Something Mimo needs</h4>
        <p>I wish that there was a test after every section so it makes sure you deserve 
            the certificate
